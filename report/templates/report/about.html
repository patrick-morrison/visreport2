    This site was built on Whadjuk Noongar boodja (country). The Noongar peoples have ongoing connections to this land and sea. I pay my respect to Elders past and present.

    Vis.Report contains a database of visibility and condition reports for dive sites around Perth, all contributed by
    users. Clicking any site on the map will display the most recent report. Clicking on
    those will show a list of all reports for that site, and allow you to contribute your own (if you are signed in). 
    Please share it around, the more people that contribute frequently, the more useful the information becomes!
    Dive sites are curated by me. If you have a suggestion for a site that isn't on here, please email <a
      href="mailto:vis.report.app@gmail.com">vis.report.app@gmail.com</a>.

        The factors affecting dive conditions and visibility are not yet fully understood, particularly in the Swan River.
      I intend to use this data to better understand long-term visibility trends. Any publication of the data will
      acknowledge that it was contributed by citizen scientists via this platform.

      JSON files for the <a href="{% url 'sites_json' %}">sites ⬇️</a> and <a
